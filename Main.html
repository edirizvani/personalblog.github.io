             <h2>About me</h2>
         </div>
         <p>I was born in Ohrid, a city that holds a special place in my heart. Growing up amidst the enchanting fusion of the lake and the town, Ohrid became the nurturing ground for my earliest education. Surrounded by rich history and the promise of the future, it was here that my deep appreciation for nature, beauty, and the vastness of the sky took root.</p>
        <p>Upon completing my elementary education, I embarked on a new chapter in Struga. It was in this picturesque city, nestled along the banks of the "Black Drin" river, that I completed my high school journey at Niko Nestor as an Economics technician. The division of the city by the flowing river mirrored the choices I faced regarding my own future and the path I would choose. As the time for university registration approached, I found myself standing at a crossroads, contemplating the possibilities between Tirana and Skopje. I chose Skopje and embraced the opportunities that awaited me at FSCE. It was amidst the myriad of my interests that I made a resolute decision to pursue a path in software engineering, firmly believing that I was paving the way for a future brimming with potential.</p>
       <p>Now, as I near the completion of my first year, I reflect upon the transformative journey I have undertaken. It has been a voyage filled with challenges, yet undeniably beautiful and meticulously organized. I am filled with contentment and confidence in the path I have chosen, as it has led me to profound self-discovery. Looking ahead, I eagerly anticipate delving into new realms of knowledge and immersing myself in the subjects that lie ahead in the upcoming year."</p>

            <h2>Hobies</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I absolutely love diving into the enchanting world of books, especially classical literature. Honore de Balzac and Fyodor Dostoyevsky are my ultimate favorites, as their writings have a timeless allure that captivates my imagination. When it comes to modern literature, Ben Blushi's works strike a chord with me, resonating deeply with my thoughts and emotions.</p>
        <p>Music is my heart's language, and I have an eclectic taste that spans across jazz, rock, and country genres. Dren Abazi, an Albanian singer, holds a special place in my heart with his soul-stirring melodies. But when it comes to rock, Scorpions take the stage as my all-time favorite band, igniting my passion with their electrifying tunes.</p>
        <p>Movies are a magical escape for me, and Christopher Nolan is the master of weaving captivating stories. His films transport me to realms beyond my imagination, leaving me in awe of his visionary storytelling.</p>
        <p>Solving problems is not only a mental exercise but also a source of pure enjoyment for me. Riddles are my playful companions, keeping my mind sharp and engaged as I unravel their clever secrets.</p>
        <p>When it's time to unwind physically, I find joy in playing volleyball and swimming. The camaraderie of playing cards with teams adds a touch of excitement and friendly competition to my leisure time. And when the words overflow within me, I let my feelings flow through the enchanting art of poetry, expressing the depths of my emotions through beautifully woven words.</p>
       <p>Motorcycles fuel my soul, unleashing a thrilling escape and a boundless sense of freedom. With every twist of the throttle, I surrender to the open road, painting unforgettable memories in the wind and forging a connection to the true essence of adventure.</p>
         <p>I also have a profound love for photography, as it allows me to capture fleeting moments and freeze them in time. Through the lens of my camera, I become an observer of life's beauty and intricacies. Whether it's capturing the vibrant colors of nature, the candid expressions of people, or the hidden details in urban landscapes, photography empowers me to tell stories and convey emotions with a single click.</p>
         <p>These hobbies of mine are more than mere pastimes; they are the threads that weave together the fabric of my soul, enriching my life with passion, inspiration, and a sense of fulfillment.</p>

        Greetings from Vienna! I'm thrilled to be here on a holiday before I kick off my second year at FSCE Skopje. This captivating city has enchanted me with its rich history, breathtaking architecture, and world-class museums.
